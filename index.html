    <h1>The Spirit of the Ronin</h1>
    <p>In feudal Japan, when a samurai became masterless—now a ronin—he carried forward not titles or affiliations, but hard-earned skills and unwavering principles. The ronin walked a path of independence, guided by personal honor rather than external authority.</p>
    <p>Without the shelter of institutional power, the ronin relied on practical mastery of diverse tools and techniques. More than just swordsmanship, they understood metallurgy, weather patterns, human psychology—each skill becoming essential when you stand alone. This breadth of knowledge allowed them to see connections and solutions invisible to specialists who knew only one way.</p>
    <p>Where others saw only constraints, the ronin found freedom in self-reliance. Their strength came not from position or resources, but from authentic purpose—using their skills to protect those who needed protection, to uncover truths others wished to remain hidden, to bring balance where power had tipped too far in one direction.</p>
    <p>The path of the ronin endures today—in those who choose independence to better serve their values of authenticity, justice, and knowledge-sharing. These modern practitioners have walked away from comfortable structures to follow their own compass. With nothing but their expertise and core tools, they offer their skills not to the highest bidder, but to causes, people and organizations that matter.</p>
